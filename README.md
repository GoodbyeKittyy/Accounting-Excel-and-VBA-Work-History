01: Spreadsheets and macros I used in my career.

We misplaced our intiial files (investment philosophy, strategy and asset selection and allocation approach). philosophy: growth, strategy: 5 factors model adjusted for pricing correction (market, size, momentum, low-dividend & high-buybacks).

04: Academic research about international diversification. Thesis: With the rise of internet, trades (trade blocs) and international consumption the value of diversification is diminishing. So, buying one of the futone 500 companies (with 35% revenues from overseas) is cheaper and optimal.
